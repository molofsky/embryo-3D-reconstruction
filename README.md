# embryo-reconstruction
An investigation of the neuroectoderm, detailing the pathways through which neuroepithelial cells differentiate into glial cells. This project spatially reconstructs a C6 human embryo by theorizing the cellular profile of intervening tissue slices and mapping them to a 3D surface plot to track the development of the human nervous system and examine how early germ layers such as the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm interact.
