# embryo-reconstruction
An investigation of the neuroectoderm, detailing the pathways through which neuroepithelial cells differentiate into glial cells. This project spatially reconstructs a developing human embryo, theorizing the cellular profile of intervening tissue slices and mapping them to a 3D surface plot to track the development of the human nervous system and examine how early germ layers such as the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm interact. 

## File Structure 
- `Images` contains images of the embryo
- `notebooks` contains all Jupyter notebooks
- `Slices` contains coordinate data for eight tissue slices from one CS6 human embryo, originally published in "The single-cell and spatial transcriptional landscape of human gastrulation and early brain development‚Äù, Zeng et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2023 Data DOI: 10.1016/j.stem.2023.04.016
