# embryo-reconstruction
An investigation of the neuroectoderm, detailing the pathways through which neuroepithelial cells differentiate into glial cells. This project spatially reconstructs a C6 human embryo by theorizing the cellular profile of intervening tissue slices and mapping them to a 3D surface plot to track the development of the human nervous system and examine how early germ layers such as the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm interact. 

## File Structure 
- `Images` contains images of the spatially reconstructed embryo and identifying different cell types in the neuro-ectoderm
- `notebooks` contains Jupyter notebooks with code for spatial reconstruction using PASTE method and cell type deconvolution using cell2location
- `Slices` contains coordinate data for eight tissue slices from one C6-stage human embryo, originally published in "The single-cell and spatial transcriptional landscape of human gastrulation and early brain development‚Äù, Zeng et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2023 Data DOI: 10.1016/j.stem.2023.04.016
